# Plan: send generated WAV to the hub and play it from tonejs-json-sequencer

## Goals
- Allow WAV generated by tone.js / web-ym2151 / wavlpf to be pushed to Cross-Origin Hub with a single “send to hub” toggle.
- Let a tonejs-json-sequencer instance connected to the hub auto-load received WAVs into its sampler via a “wav from hub” toggle.
- Keep both toggles sticky (on stays on) so new renders travel automatically while the toggle is enabled.

## Shared message shape (hub payload)
- `eventType`: `wav:generated`
- `data` object:
  - `id`: string (stable identifier for deduping/reload)
  - `name`: string (display label / filename hint)
  - `mime`: string (e.g. `audio/wav`)
  - `bytes`: base64 string of the WAV file (or ArrayBuffer if using binary WebSocket)
  - `durationMs`, `sampleRate`, `channels`: optional metadata
  - `source`: enum-like string (`tonejs`, `web-ym2151`, `wavlpf`, etc.)
- Hub already appends `from` and `timestamp`; receivers should trust `data` for audio and use `from` only as origin info.

## JS npm helper for “send to hub” (tone.js / web-ym2151 / wavlpf producers)
- Package a thin helper around `cross-origin-hub`:
  - `createWavHubSender({ serverUrl, WebSocket })` returns `{ toggleSend(on), sendWav(wavBlob | ArrayBuffer, metadata) }`.
  - Internally holds `CrossOriginHub` instance, reuses connection, and publishes `wav:generated` with the shared shape.
- UI wiring:
  - “send to hub” button toggles a boolean; while on, any newly rendered WAV is fed to `sendWav`.
  - Keep the toggle state in memory (optionally localStorage later) and show a small connected/error indicator from hub events.
- Payload handling:
  - Convert Blob/ArrayBuffer to base64 before sending to stay compatible with current JSON-only hub.
  - Cap payload size (e.g. warn if > a few MB) and avoid chunking for the MVP; revisit chunking/URLs if size becomes an issue.

## Rust cargo (local hub) expectations
- cross-origin-hub-rs should mirror the Node hub behavior:
  - Accept JSON messages with `eventType`/`data`, broadcast to other clients, and add `from` + `timestamp`.
  - Permit binary frames so future versions can skip base64 when both ends support it.
  - Provide a `--max-payload` guard to avoid accidental huge audio posts.
- Optional convenience CLI flag for this use case:
  - `--watch-wav <dir>`: watch a folder where wavlpf outputs WAVs, base64 them, and emit `wav:generated` with `source=wavlpf`. This keeps the “send to hub” experience possible even for non-browser generators.

## tonejs-json-sequencer: “wav from hub” receiver
- Add a toggle button that, when on, connects (or reuses) a `CrossOriginHub` client and subscribes to `wav:generated`.
- On message:
  1) Decode base64 to Blob, turn into Object URL.
  2) Register it into the sampler under `data.name` (or `id`) as a new slot.
  3) Provide minimal UI feedback (loaded name, duration, source).
- Handle duplicates by keying on `data.id`: replace existing sample if the same id reappears.
- Keep toggle sticky (stays on until manually turned off). If connection drops, retry via hub auto-reconnect and re-subscribe.

## Interaction model for the two toggles
- “Send to hub”: off by default; once turned on, every new WAV render auto-publishes.
- “wav from hub”: off by default; once on, all future hub-delivered WAVs auto-register.
- Start simple: no per-file prompts, no queue UI; just automatic transfer while toggled on. Add confirmations/filters only after the basic flow works.
